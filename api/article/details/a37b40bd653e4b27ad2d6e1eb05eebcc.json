The cool thing about the card is, and we'll talk about a lot of other different things to do, but I think this is like the coolest or best way to cook in the format is with this card. It's best in a bant shell, but every color adds something to the mix.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">So the best card, and I shouted this out in the draft, that has gone up for me is Sticky Tongue Sentinel. That's the two in a green three three reach, that picks something up, or you can't pick something up when it comes into play. This is just so cool.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">It's great with the talents, and the talents that we'll, as we'll talk about later, like they're almost all, all of them have moved up for me. Like they're all really sweet, even though like I said, I haven't quite done Bandit's Talent yet.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">I am playing a deck with Gossip's Talent right now. I know some people have had success with that, even though I think it's a little clunky-ish. That's the one in a blue one that your creatures surveil when they come into play, and then you can make something Power 3 or less unblockable, and then you can, the third level lets you, once a creature connects, you can blink it.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">But you can do it to any creature that connects. So if you connect with two or three, you can blink all of them, et cetera. Anyway, so Sticky Tongue Sentinel, it really does harken back for me with the class enchantments, with picking up sagas in Neon Dynasty. It's like the exact same thing.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">And it's really powerful. Like getting to, especially if you're going really deep with Builder's Talent, like getting to cast Builder's Talent, level it up all the way to three, you've gotten something back, then Sticky Tongue Sentinel is picking up Builder's Talent, you're replaying it, getting another O4, getting to rebuy the thing again from your graveyard, et cetera.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">It's really, really good. So that's, I think you at least want to be splashing it. The other reason that green adds so much with Sticky Tongue Sentinel specifically is the deck can gum up the ground easily. You can get overrun by flyers a lot. And the reach from Sticky Tongue Sentinel adds a lot of defense to the deck.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">And maybe you need a counter on it, right? But Builder's Talent is there to get up to a 4/4 so you can block the Glide Dive duos, et cetera. I think even outside of cooking with Builder's Talent, Sticky Tongue Sentinel is probably the green card that I've gained the most respect for over the last week and a half or so. Like just the body is so solid.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">Also, if you're not cooking and you're just playing with good cards, like just getting over when you pick up Hunter's Talent, like it's just stupid. I hate Hunter's Talent so much. I do think it's a little too OP. I mean, I like the card 'cause it's very powerful, but I think it's a little too egregious.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">Yeah, like the draft log, I think, was it last week that we went over where I could have picked a Sticky Tongue Sentinel second following up on Hunter's Talent and I didn't. I was like a little too early to take that card. I think now I do not think that. Now I just be like, no, I'm good. I'll just lock up this synergy and this good reach blocker right now.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">So the next thing you want to really take advantage of Builder's Talent is the creatures that will wear the counters well. And so white has one major one in my mind is Strike Force. That's the two in a white one, three, flying double strike vigilance. Vigilance. Why does it need vigilance?</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">It's like the moose, like why? What are we doing here? That gaining counters just is gonna end the game in a hurry. And the other thing I realized this week is blue's unblockable creatures. That's why I like Bant for Builder's Talent. Blue's unblockable creatures wear the counters so well.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">So obviously Shoreline Looter is a card we like a lot, but one in a blue. One, one, can't be blocked. If you don't have threshold, it's a looter when it connects. And if you do, it just draws a card when it connects. That's great.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">Then you get last pick Nightwhirl Hermits, the two in a blue, one, four, which has vigilance, I believe. And when you have threshold, it gets plus one, plus zero, and unblockable. So you're playing the long game anyway. Your deck is already interested in a three mana, one, four as a blocker. And then at a certain point, you're just like, oops, here's a five,</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">eight vigilance unblockable ending the game in a hurry. And that goes back to my point about a lot of these, like a big factor for a lot of these decks or strategies is unlocking the wheel and making use of late pick cards. And when you get pick 12, 13, 14 Nightwhirl Hermit, and then you're like, oh, dang,</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">this is actually gonna be an ace for me at some point in the game. It's very powerful. But this is also why, not to poo poo here, bring down your vibe, but this is also why the deck is not tier one, because you're playing Nightwhirl Hermits in a format where green black is just insanely powerful.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">You know? I agree. I mean, I do think like of the things we're gonna talk about today, I do think this is like, I think this deck has real legs. Like again, I don't know, like best version of this versus best version of the actual decks you're supposed to be drafting the format. No, those probably went out, but this is like tier 1.5 in my mind.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">Whereas I do think some other stuff we're gonna talk about is like tier two. True. Instant speed ways to make food is important because that turns once you get builder's talent up to level two, that turns these into combat tricks. So likeYes. That's where it's scary playing as builder's talent.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">So like paw patch formation, the one under green can blow up a flyer, an enchantment or make a food draw card. Cash grab, you wanna make sure you have like some ways to take some squirrels. We'll talk about the changelings as well, 'cause sometimes you do,</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">you do get into some looping territories here and you may want a two, three reach that can stack the bottom of your library. Savor is excellent here. That's the thing that black adds to the deck really well is Savor as a cheap removal spell, plus giving you that food instant speed.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">The thing that the cash grab does that's so great is that when you have multiple builder's talents, you've been a builder's talent and then your builder's talent that you have in play can get it back, right? Because level three lets you get back a non-creature non-line permanent and then you're just cooking.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">We'll say of all those cards, paw patch formation is just, I think, an include in most green decks in the format. It just is very good in blowing up the talents. Having a card that can blow up the talents while not costing you that much. And banishing light.</p> \n<p data-tool=\"mdnice编辑器\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.8em; letter-spacing: 0em; text-align: left; text-indent: 0em; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px;\">Right, and potentially being synergistic is strong. And then the other thing that's wild about cash grab, I don't know how I went this far in the format without realizing this, 'cause I have played green</p>",
